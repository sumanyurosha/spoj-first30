 # Concepts Learnt 
   1.In Solving problem PRIME1, I learnt a new concept of Segmented Sieve. It is used for searching primes within a range. The following links were very useful specially the youtube video. 
    [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes), 
    [Segmented Sieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fByR5N-TseY)
  
  2. I always love to play with Arrays and this time I played with arrays in a different way and solved the problem FCTRL2. I had to calculate the factorial of any integer less than 100. So this time no direct calculations but the basic concepts of 2nd Standard school helped me out. I used the array to store a number digit by digit. For example, 10483 will be stored like this {1,0,4,8,3}. Now I applied the multiplication rule like we used to apply when we are in 2nd class, yes the carry method! That's how I solved it. I am not covering complete implementation but I will surely write a blog for the full implementation of this problem.
  
  3. I used Stacks to solve the problem ONP. It was nice using stacks to solve this problem.
  
  4. I encountered an interesting problem today, COINS! Well it is a dp problem but I didn't understand the dp part in it and just solved using my conventional approach. The trick was to pre-compute values till 10^8 and use those values to calculate answers till 10^9 by using recursion.
    **I need to understand a lot more about dp**
    
  5. I Solved problem ACODE and found it really very interesting one. A very famous saying in Dynamic Programming is, "If you don't remember the past, you are condemned to repeat it". This statement justifies DP very well. DP is all about breaking a problem into sub problems and finding the overlapping solutions for it. Happy to solve it, now will look forward to more such problems.
  
  6. I solved JULKA and I am very very happy after solving it. I always knew the approach to solve it but was stucking in the implementation part. And finally I have done it!!! This problem helped me in learning how to pass an array to a function and how to return an array from a function. Because of this mistake my earlier attempts had failed. Just like the problem FCTRL, I used the most basic approach for solving mathematical addition, sbtraction and division but for very very big numbers(upto 10^10000). 
  
  7. Finally, I solved PALIN today and I am very very happy after getting AC for it. It took me two days(2 hrs each day) to implement this problem. I got the concept very early but this was more of an Implementation problem so I had to deal with all the corner cases, which took a little more time to handle. But finally, yes it always feels good to do something you have always thought of. One more down and many more to go. BOOM!! (PS: Hard work pays off :P)
  
  8. I solved STPAR problem, it was an intresting one which I solved using stacks. 
  9. Solved OLOLO, as the name is different the approach to solve it was also different. I used bitwise XOR operation to solve it. There is a lot to explore about the BITWISE operations and their applications. Got to know a new term, Bitmasking. Will surely try to know more about it!
  10. I solved Is it a Tree problem. Learnt about graph, its representation, bfs and dfs. Very happy after solving a graph problem. Way to go in Graph Theory! Also solved it using Disjoint Set Union. Good to a learn a new concept :-D!
  
### Goal Completed!
Feeling very excited and happy about it. Achieving it helped me in following ways:

 # A) Knowledge Level:

    1.) Reviving hands-on Experience.
    2.) Confidence level increment.    
    3.) Helped me write code in Java in Office in a better way.    
    4.) Growing my knowledge domain.    
    5.) Helping me dwelling a habit of working on Github.
    6.) Helping me in keeping a habit of coding every day.

# B) Psychological Level:
    1.) A good way to get away with the habit of Overthinking is to start doing something and keeping yourself
        busy and yes this helped me in every possible way.
    2.) Bridging the gap between my thoughts and reality!
    3.) Keeping yourself away from all the shit happening around you.
    4.) Staying focused on your GOALS.

### Improvements:
     -- I could have done it sooner.
     -- Time to take up the level 2 or level 3 questions, most of the above ones were elementary level.
     -- Be regular in it.
