# Goals: 
  1. Solve a problem a day.
  2. Solve the first 30 problems as early as possible.
  3. Update the readme file with the name of problems solved everyday.

 # Concepts Learnt 
   1.In Solving problem PRIME1, I learnt a new concept of Segmented Sieve. It is used for searching primes within a range. The following links were very useful specially the youtube video. 
    [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes), 
    [Segmented Sieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fByR5N-TseY)
  
  2. I always love to play with Arrays and this time I played with arrays in a different way and solved the problem FCTRL2. I had to calculate the factorial of any integer less than 100. So this time no direct calculations but the basic concepts of 2nd Standard school helped me out. I used the array to store a number digit by digit. For example, 10483 will be stored like this {1,0,4,8,3}. Now I applied the multiplication rule like we used to apply when we are in 2nd class, yes the carry method! That's how I solved it. I am not covering complete implementation but I will surely write a blog for the full implementation of this problem.
  
  3. I used Stacks to solve the problem ONP. It was nice using stacks to solve this problem.
