 # Concepts Learnt 
   1.In Solving problem PRIME1, I learnt a new concept of Segmented Sieve. It is used for searching primes within a range. The following links were very useful specially the youtube video. 
    [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes), 
    [Segmented Sieve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fByR5N-TseY)
  
  2. I always love to play with Arrays and this time I played with arrays in a different way and solved the problem FCTRL2. I had to calculate the factorial of any integer less than 100. So this time no direct calculations but the basic concepts of 2nd Standard school helped me out. I used the array to store a number digit by digit. For example, 10483 will be stored like this {1,0,4,8,3}. Now I applied the multiplication rule like we used to apply when we are in 2nd class, yes the carry method! That's how I solved it. I am not covering complete implementation but I will surely write a blog for the full implementation of this problem.
  
  3. I used Stacks to solve the problem ONP. It was nice using stacks to solve this problem.
  
  4. I encountered an interesting problem today, COINS! Well it is a dp problem but I didn't understand the dp part in it and just solved using my conventional approach. The trick was to pre-compute values till 10^8 and use those values to calculate answers till 10^9 by using recursion.
    **I need to understand a lot more about dp**
  5. I Solved problem ACODE and found it really very interesting one. A very famous saying in Dynamic Programming is, "If you don't remember the past, you are condemned to repeat it". This statement justifies DP very well. DP is all about breaking a problem into sub problems and finding the overlapping solutions for it. Happy to solve it, now will look forward to more such problems.
